# Dagger GSoC 2023

Great news! Felipe de Alcantara Tome (`@fda-tome`) is participating in the 2023 Google Summer of Code, with the goals of:
- Changing Dagger's `DArray` to use the eager API (`@spawn`/`fetch`)
- Adding MPI support to Dagger and the `DArray`
- Adding linear algebra and other utility operations to the `DArray`

I (Julian Samaroo) and Evelyne Ringoot will be mentoring Felipe for the next few months, and we've already had great communication with him over the last 1-2 months as GSoC spooled up. I'm very much looking forward to working with Felipe and Evelyne on this project, and these changes will help modernize Dagger and unlock use cases that were previously outside of its reach.
